Features implemented so far

Plan: create a single file that lists everything we've added and changed so far, with short notes and next steps.

Checklist
- [x] Database schema: migrations added for events, sessions, speakers, pivot, and is_admin on users
- [x] Models: Event, Session, Speaker added and wired to relationships
- [x] Factories: EventFactory, SessionFactory, SpeakerFactory (and existing UserFactory used)
- [x] Seeders: SampleDataSeeder + DatabaseSeeder updated to call it; sample data inserted
- [x] Admin UI: basic CRUD controllers and routes for events, sessions, speakers
- [x] Views: minimal Blade admin layout + views for events/sessions/speakers + session speaker management
- [x] Scripts: helper scripts for debugging and inspecting SQLite DB (sqlite_counts.php, print_counts.php, print_counts_debug.php, list_users.php, list_users_debug.php, inspect_users.php, make_admin.php)
- [x] Commands executed: composer dump-autoload, php artisan migrate, php artisan db:seed (DatabaseSeeder and SampleDataSeeder)

Details (what was added / where)

1) Database / Migrations
- `database/migrations/2025_10_22_000001_create_events_table.php` — events table
- `database/migrations/2025_10_22_000002_create_event_sessions_table.php` — event_sessions table
- `database/migrations/2025_10_22_000003_create_speakers_table.php` — speakers table
- `database/migrations/2025_10_22_000004_create_session_speaker_table.php` — pivot table `session_speaker` with `role`
- `database/migrations/2025_10_22_000005_add_is_admin_to_users_table.php` — adds `is_admin` boolean to `users`

Status: Done; migrations run successfully.

2) Models
- `app/Models/Event.php` — hasMany sessions
- `app/Models/Session.php` — belongsTo Event, belongsToMany Speaker (pivot role)
- `app/Models/Speaker.php` — belongsToMany Session (pivot role)
- `app/Models/User.php` — unchanged except `is_admin` column exists in DB (model can be used with `is_admin` attribute)

Status: Done; relationships set up.

3) Factories
- `database/factories/EventFactory.php`
- `database/factories/SessionFactory.php`
- `database/factories/SpeakerFactory.php`
- `database/factories/UserFactory.php` (pre-existing)

Status: Done; factories used by seeder.

4) Seeders & Sample Data
- `database/seeders/SampleDataSeeder.php` — creates an admin user (`admin@example.com`), 2 events, sessions and 6 speakers per event, attaches speakers to sessions with varied `role` values
- `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` — updated to call `SampleDataSeeder`

Status: Done; seeding executed. Quick DB counts (direct SQLite checks) show sample rows in the database (e.g. speakers and session_speaker rows present).

5) Admin UI (Controllers, Routes, Views)
- Controllers:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/EventController.php` — CRUD for events
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SessionController.php` — CRUD for sessions + manage/attach/detach speakers
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SpeakerController.php` — CRUD for speakers

- Routes: appended to `routes/web.php` under prefix `admin` and `auth` middleware. Route names use `admin.*` (e.g. `admin.events.index`, `admin.sessions.manageSpeakers`).

- Views (Blade - minimal):
  - `resources/views/admin/layout.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/admin/events/{index,create,edit}.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/admin/sessions/{index,create,edit,manage_speakers}.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/admin/speakers/{index,create,edit}.blade.php`

Status: Done; basic admin UI implemented (views are minimal). Note: routes are protected by `auth` middleware — you must log in to access them.

6) Utility scripts (for local development/testing)
- `scripts/print_counts.php` — prints counts via Laravel bootstrap
- `scripts/print_counts_debug.php` — verbose counts with try/catch
- `scripts/sqlite_counts.php` — queries SQLite file directly for table counts
- `scripts/list_users.php`, `scripts/list_users_debug.php`, `scripts/inspect_users.php` — inspect users table
- `scripts/make_admin.php` — sets `is_admin` on `admin@example.com`

Status: Done; these scripts helped verify seeding and DB state.

7) Commands run
- `composer dump-autoload` — regenerated autoload
- `php artisan migrate --force` — ran new migrations
- `php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder` — seeded sample data

Observed results: migrations completed and sample data inserted into `database/database.sqlite` (direct SQLite check shows rows for speakers and pivot entries).

8) Public sessions listing (new)
- Route: `GET /sessions` (named `sessions.index`)
- Controller: `App\Http\Controllers\SessionPublicController@index`
- View: `resources/views/sessions/index.blade.php`

What it does
- Lists sessions (paginated) and includes simple filters:
  - Day: calculated from distinct `starts_at` dates; Day 1 => first date, Day 2 => second, etc.
  - Format: filters by the `format` column (Talk, Workshop, Panel, etc.)
  - Search: searches session `title` and `description` and speaker `name`.

How to use
- Visit: `http://localhost/sessions`
- Example query strings:
  - `?day=1` — show sessions whose `starts_at` falls on Day 1
  - `?format=Workshop` — show only Workshop-format sessions
  - `?q=testing` — search sessions and speakers for "testing"
  - Combine: `?day=2&format=Talk&q=laravel`

Notes
- The page uses a minimal Blade layout (for now it extends `resources/views/admin/layout.blade.php`) and is intentionally lightweight so you can refine the UI.
- The Day filter maps sequentially to distinct dates found in sessions; if you need named conference days (e.g., "Day 1 - Oct 21" fixed mapping), we can add a dedicated `conference_days` table or add a `day_index` column to sessions.
- Performance: for large datasets you may want to add DB indexes on `starts_at`, `format`, and full-text search for `title/description`.

Status: Done — controller, route and view added. You can test locally with `php artisan serve` and visiting `/sessions`.


Files added/modified (summary)
- Added: migrations, models (Event/Session/Speaker), factories, `SampleDataSeeder`, admin controllers, admin views, route additions, scripts (debugging and admin helper), `features list.md` (this file)
- Modified: `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`, `routes/web.php`

Requirements coverage
- Database schema and seeding: Done
- Sample data created: Done (direct SQLite checks showed records)
- Admin CRUD UI: Done (basic working CRUD and speaker management)
- Admin authorization: Partially done (routes are behind `auth`; need `is_admin` authorization middleware) — Recommended: implement and register `AdminMiddleware` and protect `admin` route group.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Add and register an `AdminMiddleware` that checks `auth()->user()->is_admin` and apply it to the `admin` route group (safe, small change)
- Improve the admin UI (styles/pagination and forms)
- Add tests for the seeder and admin controllers

Which of the above next steps do you want me to do now? If you want the `AdminMiddleware` added, I'll implement it and run a quick test (marking the seeded admin user as admin if needed).
